This README is dedicated to explaining how I will generate the code for the 65C02 computer using the cc65 compiler/assembler/linker.

The first step is to follow the cc65 repo README to enable it on your machine. The second step is make your custom 'configuration' file.

The configuration file is a memory mapping file for the cc65 compiler. It also specifies the binary output files I will be using to program the ROM for my computer. Additionally, I will also have it output another binary file that can be uploaded to the computer's RAM and then exectuted.



SRC

	ROM source code

	'run-time' source code

INC

	Types of include files: reference, library and macro

		reference
			defines constants such as port addresses
			RAM labels

		library
			source code that provides services to the other programs
			for example, a math library or a driver for a real-time clock module

		macro
			used to improve quality-of-life

Notation

	labels
		subroutines
			lower-case
			cheap descriptive labels

		macros
			lower-case
			capitlize first letter of each word

		constants
			upper-case

		memory
			lower-case

	numbers
		minimun amount of characters, i.e., #0 and not #$00
